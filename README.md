Experimenting with hidden markov model

This project explores the mechanism for classifying discrete sequences using a hidden markov model. 
It's a learning excersize in looking at the mechanism of the forward backward algorithm in training the model 
and the forward algorithm in predicting state labels corresponding to sequences of evidence variables.
